// Regression test for the full-width-editor auto-promotion redirect in
// `MasterDetailLayout` (`lib/ui/core/list/master_detail_layout.dart`).
//
// The bug: the redirect that rewrites `/x/:id/edit` → `/x/:id/edit?view=full`
// for entities that default to full-width was deduped by an instance field
// (`_lastRedirectKey`) that was never cleared when the pane closed. Re-opening
// the *same* edit URL (edit a row, close, edit it again) found the key still
// equal and skipped the promotion, dropping the user into the narrow
// slide-over instead of the full-width editor.
//
// The route block is reproduced inline (the production `buildEntityRouteBlock`
// attaches an `onExit` guard that reads a `Services` provider — irrelevant to
// the redirect logic under test). The ShellRoute → MasterDetailLayout wiring
// mirrors `buildEntityRouteBlock` exactly: hasPane = matched != basePath,
// viewMode = `?view`, id from path params.
