// Regression: signing out while a billing-doc edit screen is mounted used to
// crash with a full-screen framework assertion. The root cause was
// `BillingEditTotals._ensureStream` force-unwrapping `auth.session.value!`,
// which is null during logout — the still-mounted edit screen rebuilds once
// more on the logout frame (its LayoutBuilder re-inflates the totals bar →
// didChangeDependencies → _ensureStream), the `!` threw mid-layout, and the
// downstream symptom was the `InheritedElement.notifyClients` "is not true"
// assertion. The fix routes the read through the nullable
// `auth.currentCompanyId`.
