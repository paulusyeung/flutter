/// Drives the two foreground sync mechanisms off app lifecycle transitions:

///     would otherwise sit until the next user action. Combined with the
///     connectivity listener and the post-`enqueueMutation` hook, this closes
///     the last common gap where the user sees "unsynced changes" despite
///     having been online.
///   * **Delta refresh pump** ([RefreshScheduler]) — paused while
///     backgrounded (no network ticks while away / signed out), kicked once
///     immediately on resume, then resumed on its periodic cadence.
///
/// Mirrors [PasswordCacheLifecycleObserver]: the lifecycle hook is the only
/// state, the work itself is delegated to existing repositories.
