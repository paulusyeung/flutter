// Invoice-lock policy. Mirrors admin-portal `app_actions.dart` `editEntity()`
// (the `EntityType.invoice` branch): the `lock_invoices` company setting
// blocks *editing* an invoice once it is sent / paid / past end-of-month.
//
// v2 stores the server-computed `Invoice.isLocked` flag but never enforced it
// — the editor opened anyway and the doomed mutation entered the outbox. This
// computes the lock locally (so it's correct offline, where the server flag is
// stale) and is ORed with the server flag (server wins if it says locked).
//
// Scope is invoices only — Quote / Credit / PurchaseOrder / RecurringInvoice
// have no lock setting and no `isLocked` field, matching both reference apps.
//
// Status transitions (markSent / markPaid / autoBill / cancel) are *not*
// edits and are intentionally not gated here — the VeriFactu nuance from
// `invoice_actions.dart` (only `markPaid` is blocked, because the synthetic
// payment it records is itself an edit) is preserved at the call sites.
