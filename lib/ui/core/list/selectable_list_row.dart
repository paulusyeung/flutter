/// Shared selected-row chrome for every entity list tile.

/// Replaces the per-tile hand-rolled `Material`/`InkWell`/`DecoratedBox`
/// selection styling that previously diverged across the 17 list tiles.
///
/// Design (see `docs/.../when-i-select-a-wiggly-crescent.md` plan):
///
/// * **Selected** → a flat full-bleed `accentSoft` fill with a solid 3px
///   [accent] bar on the leading edge, both painted by a single paint-only
///   `DecoratedBox` (`BorderDirectional(start: …)`). Because `DecoratedBox`
///   never affects `child`'s layout, the [child] keeps its own padding and
///   the exact same constraint flow as the unselected branch — columns stay
///   pixel-aligned with the fixed `EntityListColumnHeaders` strip and the
///   text does not shift vertically on select. No rounding, no inset, no
///   `ClipRRect` — square and flat, the classic data-table selection idiom.
/// * **Not selected** → the [child] edge-to-edge with a full-bleed bottom
///   hairline, suppressed via [hideBottomDivider] (last row, the selected
///   row itself, or the row directly above the selected one — the scaffold
///   computes this since a tile can't see its neighbour's selection state).
///   Suppressing the neighbour's hairline too is what keeps the selected
///   fill bounded by a colour change only, never trapped between gray lines.
/// * **Ink / hover** → selected rows use a bare [GestureDetector]: on macOS,
///   Material 3 paints an opaque hover overlay over a non-transparent
///   Material color and `overlayColor: transparent` does not suppress it.
///   With no `InkWell` in the tree no overlay can fire, so `accentSoft`
///   stays readable on hover. Unselected rows keep the `InkWell` (its
///   hover overlay via [_rowHoverColor] + the Material focus highlight
///   for keyboard nav). The hover color is brightness-aware: light mode
///   uses `surfaceAlt`; dark mode uses a computed `ink @ 8% over surface`
///   blend, because raw `surfaceAlt` is perceptually invisible against
///   the dark card surface.
///
/// No animation: selection snaps. Arrow-key / J-K navigation in the
/// master-detail list moves selection on every keypress; an implicit tween
/// would smear and trail the focused row.
