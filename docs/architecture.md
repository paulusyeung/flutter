# Architecture

Companion to CLAUDE.md § Architecture — at a glance. The MVVM block diagram and the layered-split summary live there; this doc carries the DI / routing / persistence / HTTP detail, the offline-first write pipeline, and the on-disk project layout.

## Layer details

- **DI**: `Services` (`lib/app/services.dart`) is a plain bag of singletons built once in `main.dart` and exposed to the widget tree via `Provider<Services>.value`. Screens grab dependencies with `context.read<Services>()`; ViewModels take their repos by constructor injection.
- **Routing**: `go_router` with a `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack` for the authenticated shell (NavigationRail on ≥600 px, NavigationBar on <600 px).
- **State**: `ChangeNotifier` + `ListenableBuilder` in views. **No Redux. No flutter_bloc. No Riverpod.** If you're tempted to add one, talk to the team first.
- **Models**: `freezed` + `json_serializable`. API DTOs in `lib/data/models/api/`, clean domain models in `lib/data/models/domain/`. Domain models are what flow up to ViewModels.
- **Persistence**: Drift on top of SQLCipher (`sqlcipher_flutter_libs`). The DB file is encrypted at rest with a per-install 256-bit key held in `flutter_secure_storage` under `invoiceninja.db.key.v1`. Drift's reactive streams drive the UI — the network layer only writes; the UI only reads from Drift. Tests use `NativeDatabase.memory()` (unencrypted, no PRAGMA key) — SQLCipher's binary accepts both.
- **HTTP**: `package:http`. Large list parses go through `compute()`.

### Navigation

**Page navigation is declarative.** Use `go_router` and the typed entity
helpers in `lib/app/router.dart` — `goEntityRecord`, `goEntityFullDetail`,
`goEntityEdit`, `goEntity`. Anything that is a routable destination (a list,
detail, edit, or settings page the user can deep-link to or land on after a
restart) belongs in the route tree, never an imperative `Navigator.push`.

**Raw `Navigator.push` is reserved for modal full-screen sub-flows** that are
not routable destinations — image crop, the design editor, full-screen
previews, pickers, the license page. These must go through a named top-level
`show*Screen` / `show*` helper colocated with the destination screen (e.g.
`showLogoCropScreen`, `showDesignEditScreen`, `showTemplatePreviewScreen`,
`showCascadeFullScreenPreview`, `showAppLicensePage`). **Never write an inline
`MaterialPageRoute(...)` at the call-site** — the helper keeps the route
construction in one place and makes the "this is a deliberate modal, not a
missing route" intent explicit.

Scope note: this rule covers `Navigator.push`. `Navigator.pop` and
`Navigator.of(context, rootNavigator: true)` (drawer dismissal, root-scoped
dialogs) are out of scope and may stay inline.

## Offline-first write pipeline

Every write goes through this pipeline:

1. Repository writes the change to Drift (`is_dirty = true`). UI updates instantly via stream.
2. Repository appends a row to the `outbox` table with an `idempotency_key`, `payload`, `mutation_kind`, and (if needed) `requires_password`.
3. `SyncRepository` drains the outbox in FIFO order **per (company, entity_type)**. Retries follow exponential backoff (5s → 30s → 2m → 10m, dead after 5 attempts).
4. On success, the row is removed; the server response upserts into Drift.
5. On `422`: row marked `dead` — shown on the Outbox screen for user action.
6. On `409` or stale-data: emits `Conflict` → `ConflictResolutionSheet` modal.
7. On `403 password-required`: emits `PasswordRequired` → `ConfirmPasswordSheet`.

**Offline create uses temp IDs** (`tmp_<uuid>`). When the server assigns a real ID, an `id_remap` row is written and any pending outbox payloads referencing the temp ID are rewritten before send. `Repository.watch(id)` resolves through `id_remap` so an open detail screen survives the swap without a URL change.

## Coding conventions — style

- Models are immutable (`freezed`). Use `copyWith` for edits.
- Repositories return **streams** for "watch" methods and **futures** for "ensure"/mutation methods. ViewModels expose `ValueListenable`-style state.
- Views are `StatelessWidget` whenever possible. Side effects go in the ViewModel.
- Avoid `setState` inside ViewModel-backed features.
- Run `dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs` during development.
- Format with `dart format .`; analyze with `flutter analyze`.
