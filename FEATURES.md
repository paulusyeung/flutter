# Feature parity tracker

Working tracker comparing every user-facing feature across the three Invoice Ninja admin clients:

- **React** — the web client at `/Users/hillel/Code/react`
- **Flutter v1** — the legacy Redux-based admin app at `/Users/hillel/Code/admin-portal`
- **Flutter v2** — this rebuild (`/Users/hillel/Code/admin`)

## Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Implemented end-to-end |
| 🟡 | Partial — UI scaffolded but missing functionality, gated by another module, or known-incomplete |
| ❌ | Not implemented (no screen, no model, no route) |
| — | N/A (feature doesn't apply to this app — e.g. biometric lock on the web, cookie banner on desktop) |

The **Live E2E** column tracks *true* automated coverage by the live
`integration_test/` suite that runs the real app against
`demo.invoiceninja.com` (see `integration_test/demo/` + `support/demo_harness.dart`):

- ✅ — covered end-to-end by a passing live test (real UI → network → assertion).
- 🟡 — partially exercised (e.g. the list/screen mounts and renders without error, but rows/behaviour aren't asserted).
- blank — not yet covered by a live test (the default; most rows).
- — — N/A (no meaningful live assertion possible for this row).

Only flip a cell here when a test genuinely asserts the behaviour; blank is the honest default.

The **AI review** column tracks whether a feature's Flutter v2 implementation
has had a deep AI review of code correctness:

- ✅ — code reviewed in depth and confirmed correct.
- blank — not yet reviewed (the default; most rows).

Only flip a cell to ✅ when a genuine deep correctness review was done; blank is
the honest default.
